This is a joint work with Yifan Bao in the NCSU GEARS summer research program. Our report and poster are presented in the repository.



The project is about domain adaptation for semantic segmentation task.  In this project, we validate the favorable performance of domain adaptation method for semantic segmentation under different settings. Moreover, we use two different segmentation models (DeeplabV2 and DeeplabV3+) as the segmentation network in the AdaptSegNet architecture and find that a better segmentation model has more significant performance improvement for domain adaptation.
